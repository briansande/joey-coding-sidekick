# Roocode Extension API Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Roocode Visual Studio Code extension's public API. It is intended for developers who want to build extensions that interact with Roocode.

## Accessing the API

To access the Roocode API, you first need to get a reference to the Roocode extension and then activate it. Once activated, the extension will return an API object that you can use to interact with Roocode.

```typescript
import * as vscode from 'vscode';
import { RooCodeAPI } from '@roo-code/types'; // Assuming you have access to the types

async function getRooCodeApi(): Promise<RooCodeAPI | undefined> {
    const rooCodeExtension = vscode.extensions.getExtension('roocode.roocode');
    if (!rooCodeExtension) {
        console.error('Roocode extension not found.');
        return undefined;
    }

    if (!rooCodeExtension.isActive) {
        await rooCodeExtension.activate();
    }

    return rooCodeExtension.exports;
}
```

The returned API object is an instance of the `API` class, which is an `EventEmitter`. This means you can listen for events using the `.on()` method and send commands using the public methods.

## API Class

The main API object exposes several methods to control Roocode tasks and configuration.

### Task Management

-   `startNewTask(options: { configuration: RooCodeSettings, text?: string, images?: string[], newTab?: boolean }): Promise<string>`: Starts a new Roocode task. Returns the `taskId` of the new task.
-   `resumeTask(taskId: string): Promise<void>`: Resumes a previously paused task.
-   `isTaskInHistory(taskId: string): Promise<boolean>`: Checks if a task exists in the history.
-   `getCurrentTaskStack()`: Returns the current stack of active tasks.
-   `clearCurrentTask(lastMessage?: string): Promise<void>`: Finishes the current sub-task.
-   `cancelCurrentTask(): Promise<void>`: Cancels the currently active task.
-   `cancelTask(taskId: string): Promise<void>`: Cancels a specific task by its ID.

### User Interaction

-   `sendMessage(text?: string, images?: string[]): Promise<void>`: Sends a message to the current task.
-   `pressPrimaryButton(): Promise<void>`: Simulates a click on the primary button in the Roocode webview.
-   `pressSecondaryButton(): Promise<void>`: Simulates a click on the secondary button in the Roocode webview.

### State and Configuration

-   `isReady(): boolean`: Returns `true` if the Roocode sidebar view has been launched.
-   `getConfiguration(): RooCodeSettings`: Gets the current Roocode settings.
-   `setConfiguration(values: RooCodeSettings): Promise<void>`: Sets the Roocode settings.
-   `getProfiles(): string[]`: Gets the names of all available configuration profiles.
-   `getProfileEntry(name: string): ProviderSettingsEntry | undefined`: Gets the details of a specific profile.
-   `createProfile(name: string, profile?: ProviderSettings, activate?: boolean): Promise<string>`: Creates a new configuration profile.
-   `updateProfile(name: string, profile: ProviderSettings, activate?: boolean): Promise<string | undefined>`: Updates an existing profile.
-   `upsertProfile(name: string, profile: ProviderSettings, activate?: boolean): Promise<string | undefined>`: Creates a profile or updates it if it already exists.
-   `deleteProfile(name: string): Promise<void>`: Deletes a profile.
-   `getActiveProfile(): string | undefined`: Gets the name of the currently active profile.
-   `setActiveProfile(name: string): Promise<string | undefined>`: Sets the active profile.

## Events

You can listen to events emitted by the API to monitor the state of Roocode tasks.

```typescript
rooApi.on('taskStarted', (taskId) => {
    console.log(`Task ${taskId} has started.`);
});
```

### Task Lifecycle Events

-   `taskCreated: (taskId: string)`: Fired when a new task is created.
-   `taskStarted: (taskId:string)`: Fired when a task starts running.

### Subtask Lifecycle Events

-   `taskPaused: (taskId: string)`: Fired when a subtask is paused.
-   `taskUnpaused: (taskId: string)`: Fired when a subtask is resumed.
-   `taskSpawned: (parentTaskId: string, childTaskId: string)`: Fired when a task creates a subtask.

### Task Execution Events

-   `message: (data: { taskId: string, action: 'created' | 'updated', message: ClineMessage })`: Fired when a new message is generated by a task.
-   `taskModeSwitched: (taskId: string, modeSlug: string)`: Fired when the mode of a task changes.

-   `taskTokenUsageUpdated: (taskId: string, usage: TokenUsage)`: Provides real-time updates on the token usage of a task.

## Data Structures

The API uses several data structures to pass information.

### `TokenUsage`

Provides information about the number of tokens used by a task.

```typescript
interface TokenUsage {
    totalTokensIn: number;
    totalTokensOut: number;
    totalCacheWrites?: number;
    totalCacheReads?: number;
    totalCost: number;
    contextTokens: number;
}
```

### `ToolUsage`

Provides information about the tools used by a task.

```typescript
type ToolUsage = Record<ToolName, {
    attempts: number;
    failures: number;
}>;
```

### `ToolName`

The following tool names are available:

-   `execute_command`
-   `read_file`
-   `write_to_file`
-   `apply_diff`
-   `insert_content`
-   `search_and_replace`
-   `search_files`
-   `list_files`
-   `list_code_definition_names`
-   `browser_action`
-   `use_mcp_tool`
-   `access_mcp_resource`
-   `ask_followup_question`
-   `attempt_completion`
-   `switch_mode`
-   `new_task`
-   `fetch_instructions`
-   `codebase_search`
-   `update_todo_list`
-   `generate_image`

### `ClineMessage`

Represents a message in the Roocode chat.

```typescript
interface ClineMessage {
    ts: number;
    type: 'ask' | 'say';
    ask?: ClineAsk;
    say?: ClineSay;
    text?: string;
    images?: string[];
    partial?: boolean;
    reasoning?: string;
    // ... and other properties
}
```

#### `ClineAsk`

A `ClineAsk` message is sent when the Roocode agent needs to **ask for permission or clarification** from the user before it can proceed. Here are the possible `ask` types:

*   `followup`: The agent is asking a clarifying question to get more information.
*   `command`: The agent is asking for permission to execute a terminal/shell command.
*   `command_output`: The agent wants to read the output from a command it just ran.
*   `completion_result`: The agent believes the task is finished and is waiting for user feedback.
*   `tool`: The agent is asking for permission to use a file system tool (e.g., `read_file`, `write_to_file`).
*   `api_req_failed`: An API request made by the agent failed, and it's asking whether to retry.
*   `resume_task`: The agent needs confirmation to resume a task that was paused.
*   `resume_completed_task`: The agent needs confirmation to resume a task that was already marked as completed.
*   `mistake_limit_reached`: The agent has made too many errors and needs guidance from the user.
*   `browser_action_launch`: The agent is asking for permission to launch or interact with a browser.
*   `use_mcp_server`: The agent wants to use a tool from a connected MCP server.
*   `auto_approval_max_req_reached`: The agent has reached its limit for automatically approved actions and now requires manual approval.

#### `ClineSay`

A `ClineSay` message is sent when the Roocode agent wants to **provide information** to the user. These are informational messages that don't require a direct response. Here are the possible `say` types:

*   `error`: A general error message.
*   `api_req_started`: Informs the user that an API request has been initiated.
*   `api_req_finished`: Informs the user that an API request has completed.
*   `text`: A general text message or response from the agent.
*   `reasoning`: The agent's thought process or reasoning behind an action (this is often hidden but available for debugging).
*   `completion_result`: The final result of a completed task.
*   `user_feedback`: A message containing feedback provided by the user.
*   `command_output`: The output from an executed command.
*   `browser_action_result`: The result of an action performed in the browser.
*   `subtask_result`: The result from a completed subtask.
*   ...and several others for more specific situations like retries, warnings, and context changes.
